Exercise 1: Mailing Address
Write a program that displays your name and complete mailing address formatted in
the manner that you would usually see it on the outside of an envelope. Your program
does not need to read any input from the user.

Code:

name="Aniket Borawake"
Email="aniketborawake123@gmail.com"
print(f"Name : {name}")
print(f"Email : {Email} ")

Exercise 2:Area of a Room
Write a program that asks the user to enter the width and length of a room. Once
the values have been read, your program should compute and display the area of the
room. The length and the width will be entered as floating point numbers. Include
units in your prompt and output message; either feet or meters, depending on which
unit you are more comfortable working with.

Code:

lenght=float(input("Enter the lenght of room : "))
width=float(input("Enter the width of room : "))
area=lenght*width
print("Area of room is : ",area)

Exercise 3:Area of a Field

Create a program that reads the length and width of a farmerâ€™s field from the user in
feet. Display the area of the field in acres.
Hint: There are 43,560 square feet in an acre.

Code:

lenght=float(input("Enter the lenght of farm : "))
width=float(input("Enter the width of farm : "))
area=lenght*width
acre=area/43560
print("Acre  : ",acre)

Exercise 4: Bottle Deposits

In many jurisdictions a small deposit is added to drink containers to encourage people
to recycle them. In one particular jurisdiction, drink containers holding one liter or
less have a $0.10 deposit, and drink containers holding more than one liter have a
$0.25 deposit.
Write a program that reads the number of containers of each size from the user.
Your program should continue by computing and displaying the refund that will be
received for returning those containers. Format the output so that it includes a dollar
sign and always displays exactly two decimal places.

Code:

small_bottel=int(input("Enter the number of small bottel you want recycle : "))
large_bottel=int(input("Enter the number of large bottel you want recycle : "))

small_deposit=small_bottel*0.10
large_deposit=large_bottel*0.25
total=small_deposit+large_deposit
print(f"You got {small_deposit} $ for small bottel")
print(f"You got {large_deposit} $ for large bottel")
print(f"You got  total : {total} $")

Exercise 5:Tax and Tip

The program that you create for this exercise will begin by reading the cost of a meal
ordered at a restaurant from the user. Then your program will compute the tax and
tip for the meal. Use your local tax rate when computing the amount of tax owing.
Compute the tip as 18 percent of the meal amount (without the tax). The output from
your program should include the tax amount, the tip amount, and the grand total for
the meal including both the tax and the tip. Format the output so that all of the values
are displayed using two decimal places.

Code:

meal = float(input("Enter the cost of the meal: "))
tax_rate = 0.10
tax_amount = meal * tax_rate
tip_amount = meal* 0.18
total_cost = meal+ tax_amount + tip_amount

print(f"Tax Amount : ${tax_amount:}")
print(f"Tip Amount : ${tip_amount}")
print(f"Total cost Amount: ${total_cost}")

Exercise 6:   Height Units
Many people think about their height in feet and inches, even in some countries that
primarily use the metric system. Write a program that reads a number of feet from
the user, followed by a number of inches. Once these values are read, your program
should compute and display the equivalent number of centimeters.


Code:


cm=30.48
hight=float(input("Enter your hight in feet : "))
hight_in_cm=hight*cm
print(f"your hight in cm :{hight_in_cm}")
